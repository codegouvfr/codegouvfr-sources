<div class="fr-highlight"> <p>If you are a French public agency and want to add new source code repositories, please read our <a target="new" href="https://code.gouv.fr/documentation/">documentation</a> and <a href="mailto:contact@code.gouv.fr">do send us an email</a>. </p> </div>

## Why this website?

Many agencies already publish source code repositories : we are listing them on this website to make it easier to find them and to encourage administrations to reuse them or to contribute to them.

Source code bought or developed by public agencies are considered administrative documents, due to be opened as open data.

### What is a "source code repository"?

The *source code* is the human-readable version of a computer program.  A *source code repository* is the set of files for a computer program.  All source code repositories listed on this website use Git as their versioning system.

This website only references repositories from organizational accounts (GitHub) or public groups (gitlab.com or GitLab instances) : repositories on personal accounts are not listed.
