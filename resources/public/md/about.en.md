## Why this website?

Many agencies already publish source code repositories : we are listing them on this website to make it easier to find them and to encourage administrations to reuse them or to contribute to them.

<div class="fr-highlight"> <p>If you are a French public agency and want to add new source code repositories, please read our <a target="new" href="https://code.gouv.fr/documentation/">documentation</a> and <a href="mailto:contact@code.gouv.fr">do send us an email</a>. </p> </div>

Source code bought or developed by public agencies are considered administrative documents, due to be opened as open data.

## What is a "source code repository"?

The *source code* is the human-readable version of a computer program.  A *source code repository* is the set of files for a computer program.  All source code repositories listed on this website use Git as their versioning system.

This website only references repositories from organizational accounts : repositories on personal accounts are not listed.
