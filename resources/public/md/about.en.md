## Why this website?

Source code bought or developed by public agencies are considered
administrative documents, due to be opened as open data.

Many agencies already publish source code repositories : we are
listing them on this website to make it easier to find them and to
encourage administrations to reuse them or to contribute to them.

## How is it built?

This website is developed in four stages:

1. [codegouvfr-sources](https://git.sr.ht/~etalab/codegouvfr-sources) contains the list of organization and group accounts on github.com, gitlab.com or local GitLab forges;
2. [codegouvfr-fetch-data](https://git.sr.ht/~etalab/codegouvfr-fetch-data): fetches data from organizations and repositories from this list;
3. [codegouvfr-consolidate-data](https://git.sr.ht/~etalab/codegouvfr-consolidate-data) consolidate the data et add the list of dependencies;
4. [code.gouv.fr](https://git.sr.ht/~etalab/code.gouv.fr) expose the data.


## Where to download the data?

- The list of organizations as [csv](/data/organizations/csv/all.csv) and [json](/data/organizations/json/all.json)
- The list of repositories as [csv](/data/repositories/csv/all.csv) and [json](/data/repositories/json/all.json)
- The list of dependencies as [json](/data/deps.json)
