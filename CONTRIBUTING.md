# Contributing

You can contribute by sending your patches to `~codegouvfr/dev@lists.sr.ht`.  Remember to configure your local copy of the repository as follows:

    git config format.subjectPrefix ‘PATCH codegouvfr-sources’.

Commit messages should be written in English.

You can also create an account on <https://sr.ht> and send us your username, we will give you write access and you can publish your contributions directly on the `main` branch.

We only accept contributions if they are *signed off* with the contributor's real name.

By signing off their contributions, contributors accept the [developer certificate of origin](https://developercertificate.org).

If you wish, you can also send your suggestions directly to `contact@code.gouv.fr`.

We do not handle pull requests. If you don't know how to contribute without doing a pull request, make one, add `.patch` at the end of the URL of the PR, download the patch and send it as an email attachment to `~codegouvfr/dev@lists.sr.ht`.
